# Unit 1: Primitive Types

You’ll learn the fundamentals of Java, a programming language, as well as other foundational concepts for coding.

# Unit 2: Using Objects

You’ll explore reference data as a way to represent real-world objects in a digital world and discover methods to perform more complex operations.

# Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements

You’ll delve into the building blocks of algorithms and focus on using conditional statements to solve problems and control results.

# Unit 4: Iteration

You’ll learn about iteration, another building block of algorithms that are for repetition.

# Unit 5: Writing Classes

You’ll explore how real-world interactions can be expressed digitally by organizing behaviors and attributes into classes, and you’ll examine the legal and ethical implications of computer programming.

# Unit 6: Array

You’ll learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of related data, known as data structures.

# Unit 7: ArrayList

You’ll delve deeper into data sets, exploring ArrayList objects for larger amounts of data, as well as the privacy concerns related to personal data storage.

# Unit 8: 2D Array

Now that you’ve explored 1D arrays, you’ll branch out into 2D arrays and experiment with data sets represented in a table.

# Unit 9: Inheritance
You’ll learn how to manipulate programming without altering existing code by using subclasses to create a hierarchy.

# Unit 10: Recursion
You’ll work on solving larger problems by solving smaller, simpler versions of the same problem using recursive methods.
