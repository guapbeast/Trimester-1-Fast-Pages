# Lesson 1: Welcome to CSA

I learned about the key characteristics that it takes for success in the field of software engineering.


# Lesson 2: Java Lab

I learned about actual Java syntax and how certain errors/typos in Java can result in a program that doesn't work. I also learned about the different types of mistakes that result in syntax errors.

# Lesson 3: The Neighborhood

I learned that classes are blueprints that define the attributes and behaviors that an object can have.

# Lesson 4: Navigating and Painting

I learned the syntax for calling methods in Java to call methods.

# Lesson 5: One-Way Selection Statements

I learned how to use if statements in Java to maked decisions based on when a condition is either true or false

# Lesson 6: PainterPlus

I learned how to create a subclass to a superclass in Java. Subclasses have all of the attibutes of the Superclass.

# Lesson 7: Writing Methods

I learned how to use a new void method in order to increase a subclasses' abilities and capabilities. Methods from a subclass cannot be accesssed in a superclass.

# Lesson 8: Code Reviews

It's important to comment on code when reviewing it so that clear communication can be established between the author and the reviwer.

# Lesson 9: Loops

I learned about using while loops in order to execute a portion of code while the condition is true.

# Lesson 10: Two-Way Selection Statements

I learned how to efficiently use boolean statements in order to run portions of code based of of a condition. I also learned more aout the not operator and its uses.

# Lesson 11: Debugging Strategies

I learned to print information to the console as a debugging tool to identify logic errors in my programs. 

# Lesson 12: Decomposition and Design

I learned more about learning pseudocode and using decomposition and top-down design to deconstruct problems into smaller tasks and develop algorithms for tasks.

# Lesson 13: PatternPainter

I learned about the use of special behaviors. I also learned about using algorithms to write methods.

# Lesson 14: BackgroundPainter

I further practiced the use of decomposition and use of subclasses.

# Lesson 15: Open Source Code

I learned about the real-world applications of computer science takeaways.
