I learned about the key characteristics that it takes for success in the field of software engineering.

# Lesson 2: Java Lab

I learned about actual Java syntax and how certain errors/typos in Java can result in a program that doesn't work. I also learned about the different types of mistakes that result in syntax errors. 

# Lesson 3: The Neighborhood

You’ll delve into the building blocks of algorithms and focus on using conditional statements to solve problems and control results.

# Lesson 4: Navigating and Painting

You’ll learn about iteration, another building block of algorithms that are for repetition.

# Lesson 5: One-Way Selection Statements

You’ll explore how real-world interactions can be expressed digitally by organizing behaviors and attributes into classes, and you’ll examine the legal and ethical implications of computer programming.

# Lesson 6: PainterPlus

You’ll learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of related data, known as data structures.
